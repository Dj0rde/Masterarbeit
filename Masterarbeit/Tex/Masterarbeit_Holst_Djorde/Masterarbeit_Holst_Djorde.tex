    It is not easy to write a thesis that does not only advance
    science, but that is also a pleasure to read. While the scientific
    contribution of a thesis is undoubtedly of greater importance, the
    impact of \emph{writing well} should not be underestimated: If
    the person who grades a thesis finds no pleasure in the reading,
    that person are also unlikely to find pleasure in giving outstanding
    grades. A well-written text uses good German or English phrasing with a clear and correct 
    sentence structure and language rhythm, there are no spelling
    mistakes and the author's arguments are presented in a
    clear, logical and understandable manner using well-chosen
    examples and explanations. In addition, a nice-to-read font and a
    pleasing layout are also helpful. The \LaTeX\ class presented in
    this document helps with the latter: It contains a number of
    ready-to-use designs and 
    takes care of many small typographical chores.

Writing a bachelor's or master's thesis is not easy.\footnote{Neither
  is writing a PhD thesis, but this document does \emph{not} concern
  them. It is intended \emph{only} as a template for bachelor's and
  master's theses written at the University of Lübeck. When you write
  a PhD thesis, you are invited to find your own style.} You must
\emph{research} the thesis's topic scientifically 
-- and you must do 
this well. You must \emph{describe} your research and the results --
and you must use not just any words, but those that are used in the
scientific community. Finally, you must \emph{write} everything
\emph{down} -- by creating an electronic document that is a pleasure
to read.

It is the last item where this text may help: It is, first, a
\emph{template} that you, dear student, can copy and then modify when
writing your thesis. Of course, you still have to write the text, but
the template will take care of numerous technical details for you. As
a teaser, have a look at Listing~\vref{listing-hello-world}, which 
shows the code for the ``hello world of theses''\footnote{In computer
  science, a ``Hello World'' program is a minimal program in a given
  programming language that   just prints these two words.} and which
already produces a \textsc{pdf} file with five pages of so-called front
matter (like the title page, the abstract or the table of contents)
and already four pages of actual content -- not bad for a single page
of code.

This template document is a \LaTeX\ document that uses the
\textsc{uzl-thesis} document class. This means that in order to work with it,
you need to use Donald Knuth's \TeX\ text processing system
\cite{Knuth1986}, Leslie Lamport's \LaTeX\ extension of \TeX\
\cite{Lamport1994} and my
(that is, Till Tantau's) 
\textsc{uzl-thesis} document class. In particular, you will need to learn
\LaTeX\ if you have not already done so (definitely a good idea
anyway). 

Some students may wonder at this point whether this text
applies to them at all since they do not intend to (or perhaps even
may not) use \LaTeX\ for their thesis. However, while these readers
can safely skip the technical details of how the \textsc{uzl-thesis} class is
used, I would like to urge them (and, of course, everyone else) to read
Chapter~\ref{chapter-tips}, starting \vpageref{chapter-tips}: In this
chapter, I explain my views on 
``how to write a good thesis'' and try to give as many practical hints
as possible that anyone attempting to write a thesis will hopefully
find useful -- independently of which text processing tool they use.

The ``hints'' given in Chapter~\ref{chapter-tips} address many of the
problems that I see students struggle with when they write their
thesis. Of course, I cannot give a magic recipe for creating a
scientific breakthrough. But I \emph{can} give you hints on how to
put a breakthrough into words that other people understand and will
like to read -- and, hopefully, will like to reward with good grades.

Please be aware that the views expressed in Chapter~\ref{chapter-tips}
are \emph{my} views and some of them may not be shared by other
professors and, more importantly for you, they may not be shared by
your adviser -- who happens to be the person who will grade your
thesis. This means that you better \emph{always listen to your
  adviser} and do what she or he asks you to do.\footnote{If your adviser
thinks the thesis should be typeset using a typewriter font with
double line spacing and all headlines should be in pink, then I may
(very) strongly disagree with that, but you do not have that luxury
and you just typeset everything in double line spacing pink
typewriter.} The excuse ``but 
Professor Tantau writes that\dots'' may be flattering to me, but it
will not get you high grades.

So, \emph{always listen to your adviser.} You will read this again
later on. Repeatedly. 



\dots

This thesis\footnote{Actually, ``this text'' would be more appropriate
  since this is obviously not a real thesis. But this is what you
  would write in a real thesis at this point.} consists of two main
chapters: Chapter~\ref{chapter-use} describes how the
\textsc{uzl-thesis} \LaTeX\ class is used on a technical level. This chapter starts with the
technical details of how you setup the \TeX\ work-flow in conjunction
with the class (where to install it and which programs to use), but
the bulk of the chapter is taken up by the different aspects of using
that class -- like how bibliographies are created or how math text
should be written. The explanations only try to highlight what is
important and different when using the \textsc{uzl-thesis} class; they
are not intended as a complete introduction to \LaTeX. In
Chapter~\ref{chapter-tips}, I then list the many small and big things
you should consider and take care of when writing a thesis. I will
explain how long the different parts should be, I will sketch why the
abstract, the introduction and the conclusion all summarize the main
part of the thesis, but still all three need to be written, I will
explain why you should write ``we will show that'' and not ``I will
show that'' but ``I believe that'' and not ``we believe that'' and I
will give recommendations on many other topics. But of course,
whatever you read in the following, remember that you must
\emph{always listen to your adviser!}  




\section{Test Kram}

With the thesis class, you add figures and tables using the standard
\texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environments. You should always add
a caption to a figure and the caption should be below it, while the
caption of a table should be above it. You should always label the
figure and you \emph{must} reference all figures at least once in the
text. See Question~\vref{qu-captions} for some hints on what to write
in captions. 


\section{Creating Graphics}
\label{section-graphics}

\subsection{External Graphics}
\label{section-external}

Graphics (like plots, images, drawings or other data visualizations)
can be added to a \LaTeX\ document in two ways: First, you can include
an \emph{external graphic} like a \textsc{pdf} file or a \textsc{jpg} 
file. Second, you can use  “describe your graphic using \LaTeX\
commands”. We discuss external graphics next, internal ones later on.

You include external graphics using the includegraphicscommand,
which is a standard \LaTeX\ command. There is no need to include any
packages for this, it is available automatically. For instance, you
could say:

\begin{Latex}
The university slogan \includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-slogan.pdf} in a sentence.
\end{Latex}
to get: “The university slogan \includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-slogan.pdf} in a
sentence.” 

As can be seen, the effect of the includegraphics command is to
directly include the graphic at the very position in the line where
the command is used. Indeed, from \TeX's point of view, an external
graphic is indistinguishable from a black rectangle of the same size
as the graphic.

You will rarely wish to put a graphic in the middle of a sentence
(although there are applications). Instead, you will usually place it
inside a |{figure}| environment: Recall that it is the job of the
environment to creating “floating” text with a caption -- and it is
then the job of includegraphics to replace the “text” by a
picture. Here is an example of how you will usually do this:

\begin{Latex}
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-uzl.pdf}
  \caption{The logo of the University of Lübeck. It consists...}
  \label{fig-logo}
\end{figure}
\end{Latex}
The result is Figure~\vref{fig-logo}.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-uzl.pdf}
  \caption{The logo of the University of Lübeck. It consists of the
    university's seal together with the text “Universität zu
    Lübeck”. The corporate design manual of the university requires
    this logo to be put at the upper left corner of title pages of
    university publications.}
  \label{fig-logo}
\end{figure}

The includegraphicscommand takes many options, the most important
of which are likely |height| and |width|. These allow you to scale the
graphic to a given height or width. \emph{Avoid these options whenever
  possible.} The reason is that most graphics have a natural size
(such as the logo) in which the text and fonts in the graphic are at
the correct sizes. Any scaling will cause the graphic to become too
large or too small. \emph{Scaling is evil} and you will find more
comments on this in Question~\vref{qu-scaling}. All professors I
know find scaled-down graphics with unintelligible text \emph{among
  the most irritating things a student could  possibly do.}  

This means that when you \emph{create} graphics with another program,
make \emph{sure} that any text in the external graphic has the same
size as normal text in the thesis and that \emph{no} scaling is needed.

\subsection{Inline Graphics via Ti\emph kZ}
\label{section-tikz}

The alternative to external graphics are \emph{internal}
graphics. They are created using special \LaTeX\ commands such as the
following:
\begin{Latex}
\tikz \draw [->] (0,0) -- (1cm, 2mm);
\end{Latex}
which yields \tikz \draw [->] (0,0) -- (1cm, 2mm); when used in a
paragraph. A more complex example would be 
\begin{Latex}
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] {
  \node [block = emph]                             (h) {Hello};
  \node [small node = emph blue, right = 5mm of h] (w) {Welt};
  \draw (h) edge[bend left=15, <->] (w);
}
\end{Latex}
which yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] {
  \node [block = emph]                              (h) {Hallo};
  \node [small node  = emph blue, right = 5mm of h] (w) {Welt};
  \draw (h) edge[bend left=15, <->] (w);
}.

The Ti\emph kZ package is used for these inline graphics and it is
loaded automatically -- so \emph{if} you are going to create inline
graphics, use Ti\emph kZ. If you wish to learn Ti\emph kZ, please read
the tutorials from the manual \cite[Part I]{Tantau2019}.

The thesis class sets up some styles for Ti\emph kZ that you can
either explicitly use or that are generally set up. For instance, the
default arrow tip is setup according to the chosen design as well as
the standard line width. You usually do not need to worry about these
automatic settings.



\subsection{Predefined Ti\emph kZ Styles}

There are several styles that are predefined and that you are
“invited” to use: 

\begin{description}
\item[base shape] This is a style on which the styles described next
  are based. It is to be used with the |node| command and will, for
  instance, fill the node with white color and will draw a thick
  border around it. The color that is used for the border can be
  passed as an argument, but see below for which colors you should
  use. Here is a simple example how this style is used:
  \begin{Latex}
\tikz \node [base shape, ellipse] {Hello};    
  \end{Latex}
  yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [base shape, ellipse] {Hello};.

  The default color used for shapes is defined by the design (either
  black or the color |Ozeangruen|, which is the university's corporate
  design color, depending on the design). 
\item[small shape] This style can be used in addition to |base shape|
  and will change the font to a smaller size and will reduce 
  the inner seperation:
  \begin{Latex}
\tikz \node [base shape, small shape, ellipse] {Hello};    
  \end{Latex}
  yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [base shape, small shape, ellipse] {Hello};.
\item[block] A rectangular node: |\tikz \node [block] {Hello};| yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [block] {Hello};.
\item[small block] A smaller version: Saying
|\tikz \node [small block] {Hello};|
  will now give
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [small block] {Hello};.
\item[node] A circular node, especially in a graph: |\tikz \node [node] {$n$};|
  yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [node] {$n$};.
\item[small node] Small version: |\tikz \node [small node] {$n$};|
  yields
\tikz [baseline, anchor=base] \node [small node] {$n$};.
\item[tiny node] A small, unnamed circular node: |\tikz \node [tiny node] {};|
  yields
  \tikz \node [tiny node] {};.
\item[paper] This is a special style that installs a “paper-like
  background” as fill color. I recommend using this style as a
  background for all cases where you wish to create the impression of
  showing an “original text” from another paper, that is, where you
  wish to show that the text or graphic “looks like this in the
  original”. Consider for instance,
  \begin{Latex}
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \tikz \node [paper] {\includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-uzl.pdf}};    
  \caption{The logo of the University of Lübeck, but now...}
  \label{fig-logo-paper}
\end{figure}
\end{Latex}
which yields Figure~\ref{fig-logo-paper}.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \tikz \node [paper] {\includegraphics{uzl-thesis-logo-uzl.pdf}};    
  \caption{The logo of the University of Lübeck, but now with a
    “paper-like background”. Note how, compared to
    Figure~\ref{fig-logo}, a much stronger impression is created that
    this figure depicts something printed.}
  \label{fig-logo-paper}
\end{figure}
\end{description}

An example of how many of these styles can be used is shown in
Figure~\vref{fig-tikz-white}.

\subsection{Predefined Colors}

The thesis class defines a number of colors that you should use in
graphics. You should \emph{not} use colors like |red| or |green|: Pure
green is a very light color and text in this color is hard to read on
paper and impossible to read in an electronic document. Instead of
pure green, a rather dark version of green must be used. In contrast,
pure blue is already rather dark and only needs to be darkened very
slightly. The following colors have been setup to provide a uniform
contrast against a white background:

\begin{description}
\item[emph]
  A red color.
  Used in an outline
  \tikz[baseline] \draw [thick,emph] (0,-.2ex) rectangle ++(3.2ex,1.6ex);
  and filled
  \tikz[baseline] \fill[emph] (0,.5ex) circle[radius=.8ex];
\item[emph red] This is the same as |emph|.
\item[emph green]
  Used in an outline
  \tikz[baseline] \draw [thick,emph green] (0,-.2ex) rectangle ++(3.2ex,1.6ex);
  and filled
  \tikz[baseline] \fill[emph green] (0,.5ex) circle[radius=.8ex];
\item[emph blue]
  Used in an outline
  \tikz[baseline] \draw [thick,emph blue] (0,-.2ex) rectangle ++(3.2ex,1.6ex);
  and filled
  \tikz[baseline] \fill[emph blue] (0,.5ex) circle[radius=.8ex];
\item[emph black] This is just black:
  Used in an outline
  \tikz[baseline] \draw [thick,emph black] (0,-.2ex) rectangle ++(3.2ex,1.6ex);
  and filled
  \tikz[baseline] \fill[emph black] (0,.5ex) circle[radius=.8ex];
\end{description}

Looking for more colors? Think carefully whether you really need more:
It is hard to remember too many colors as a reader. It may be better
to use a different style (like thicker lines) for
purposes of further differentiation.



\subsection{Designs for Ti\emph kZ Graphics}

In addition to the designs for the whole thesis, see
Section~\ref{section-styling}, there are also three designs for
graphics. Each of them redefines |base shape|, resulting in a
different “look”:


\begin{description}
\item[thesis outline shapes] This Ti\emph kZ style defines
  |base shape| and all styles built on top of it (like |block| and |node|)
  to a white background and simple thick line around the shape. For
  instance:
\begin{Latex}
\tikzset{thesis outline shapes} % generally set the design
\tikz \node [block] {Hello};    
\end{Latex}
yields
{%
\tikzset{thesis outline shapes}% generally set the design
\tikz[baseline, anchor=base] \node [block] {Hello};%    
}. See Figure~\vref{fig-tikz-white} for a larger example.
\item[thesis box shapes] This style defines |base shape| similarly to
  the outline style, but fills the shapes with a light background:
\begin{Latex}
\tikzset{thesis box shapes} % generally set the design
\tikz \node [block] {Hello};    
\end{Latex}
yields
{%
\tikzset{thesis box shapes}% generally set the design
\tikz[baseline, anchor=base] \node [block] {Hello};%    
}. See Figure~\vref{fig-tikz-box} for an example.
\item[thesis flat shapes] This style redefines |base shape|
  differently: The shapes are only filled and no border is 
  drawn. This creates a stylish “flat” look:
\begin{Latex}
\tikzset{thesis flat shapes} % generally set the design
\tikz \node [block] {Hello};    
\end{Latex}
yields
{%
\tikzset{thesis flat shapes}% generally set the design
\tikz[baseline, anchor=base] \node [block] {Hello};%   
}. See Figure~\vref{fig-tikz-flat} for a larger example.
\end{description}

\section{Causality}
\label{section-Causality}

Causality describes a cause-and-effect relationship. One such relationship is the well-known fact that smoking causes lung cancer. Thus, we can say there is a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer. 
\cite{causal_graphs}

\subsection{Causal Diagrams}
\label{subsection-Causal_Diagrams}

Causal diagrams, also referred to as causal graphs, are a way to visualize causality. To do so, I will use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A DAG is made out of nodes and edges. The nodes represent the variables, both measured and unmeasured. To display the node, it is common to use the corresponding variable name. Since a DAG is directed, the edges are arrows that connect parent nodes with child nodes (Parent $\rightarrow$ Child). In our case, the parent node represents an action or cause, the child represents the outcome, and the arrow represents a direct causal relationship. Accordingly, a missing edge indicates a missing direct causal relationship between two nodes. 

Furthermore, these edges can be weighted. In our case, this weight would most likely represent the probability of P causing C (Wrong? Do we even have weighted graphs? TODO). 

Since a DAG is also acrylic, these edges are not allowed to draw cycles or loops. We need this limitation because a variable can not be the cause of itself. 

Additionally, for the DAG to be causal, it must include all common causes of any pair of variables. (TODO leave in?)

Overall, it represents causal pathways. This means every variable is the effect of all its ancestors and the cause of all its descendants.

A known to be correct causal DAG is named a ground truth DAG.

\cite{causal_graphs}




\subsection{Causation vs. Correlation}
\label{subsection-Causation_vs._Correlation}

We might be tempted to think that a strong correlation in our data also means that there is a cause-and-effect relationship. But does the crowing rooster make the sun rise? No, it does not. Strongly correlated variables do not necessarily have a cause-and-effect relationship. Especially when we look at observational data, correlations are unlikely to hint at a causal relationship. This is because, most of the time, a human has already predicted an outcome and engaged in behavior that leads to a more desirable one. This is also why there can be casual relationships between variables that have no observable correlation. Someone intervened, but it was not measured. 

TODO Maybe the sailor example if there is time. Maybe in Confounding for masking

This intervening individual would be a confounding factor. IS IT THOUGH? TODO 

\cite{mixtape} chapter 1 Intoduction \\


\subsection{Covariates}
\label{subsection-Covariates}

Invariance means the causal relationship between X-> Y is still there even if we intervene on other paths.
Invariant means unchanged.
The Markov blanket is used to train models from observational data. It leads to the optimal prediction of Y in this specific training model. 
The Markov Blanket is the minimum set of variables to condition on to block all paths from variables outside the set. This result leads to the optimal prediction of Y in the SAME DISTRIBUTION. The same distribution means there is no additional intervention or something similar. In other words, the graph has to stay the same. 
Suppose we want to predict Y in another distribution because we added an intervention node to the original training distribution. In that case, we only use the parents of Y for the conditioning set for optimal prediction. This is because if we intervene on any other node than the parents, we could be masking causal association or worse. This is called the optimal robust prediction.

\subsection{Confounders}
\label{subsection-Confounders}

TODO


A confounding factor influences both the cause and the effect variable. 
By influencing both variables, a confounding factor can lead to three things:
\\
1. A false assumption of cause and effect. For example, by being the actual
cause of both. So both variables might rise and fall concurrently, giving the 
impression of being in a causal relationship.
\\
2. The confounder could be the real cause. By not accounting for it one could
identify the wrong cause. This wrong cause would most likely be associated with the 
confounder.
\\
3. Choosing the wrong direction. TODO
\\
cite Chat GPT lul can't do that, can you?

\subsection{Colliders}
\label{subsection-Colliders}



\subsection{Causal Inference}
\label{subsection-Causal_Inference}

Causal Inference is about inferring the causal effect of a specific treatment ($T$) or action on an outcome ($Y$). Let us assume that the treatment is taking a pill. We either let a person ($i$) take the pill (do($T=1$)) or we do not (do($T=0$)). This leads to two possible outcomes: 

the outcome where person $i$ did take the pill ($Y_i |_{\text{ do}(T=1)} \triangleq Y_i(1)$) 

and the outcome where person $i$ did not ($Y_i |_{\text{ do}(T=0)} \triangleq Y_i(0)$).\\
Now, we can measure the effect, also known as the individual treatment effect (ITE), through $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$. Assuming that $Y_i(x)$ can be $0$ or $1$, we could get three different ITEs: $1$, $0$, and $-1$. $1$ and $-1$ would mean that the treatment had an effect while $0$ would mean it did not.\\
 \\
However, it is not as simple as it looks. We need to know $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$, but we can only choose one path per person. The only way to get the other outcome is to estimate it. This estimated outcome is known as a counterfactual, while the outcome of the chosen path is known as a factual. There are methods to estimate those counterfactuals. 
(TODO) I'll explain some of them in cite \dots, \dots, and \dots.
But for now, we assume we know how to get them.

If we have more records of our pill treatment, we can compute all their measured effects and take the average treatment effect (ATE). This average is also known as the expected value ($\mathbb{E}$) of $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ or  $\mathbb{E} [Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$. This is the same as taking the average of $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ and then subtracting them ($\mathbb{E} [Y_i(1)] - \mathbb{E} [Y_i(0)]$). We know that because of the linearity of expectation.

\section{Can Large Language Models Build Causal Graphs?}
\label{section-Causal_Graphs_Paper}



\subsection{The Algorithm}
\label{subsection-Causal_Graphs_Paper_Algorithm}

In this paper \citeauthor{causal_graphs} used a pairwise prompting strategy. First, they computed every possible ordered pair, also called a tuple, of nodes from the given DAG. Then, they let the expert evaluate if a statement is true or false. Those statements stayed the same for every tuple (A, B). For example: "A increases the risk of developing B" If the statement was found to be true, this would have meant there is that the given tuple was connected via a directed edge (A $\rightarrow$ B). And if the statement was false, there would be no DIRECTED edge between A and B. A connection from B to A would have been still possible in both cases. 

\cite{causal_graphs}\\



\section{Causal Order: The Key to Leveraging Imperfect Experts in Causal Inference}
\label{section-Causal_Order_Paper}

- Pairwise prompts are not able to distinguish between direct and indirect edges. 

-A causal Graph is not a great output for domain knowledge because edges indicate a DIRECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP. So, the incorporation of potential mediators between two variables is necessary.
- To alleviate that problem, they introduce causal order 
(- Causal order describes a sequence or permutation of nodes ($\pi$) wherein all nodes before a given node $X_i$ cannot be its descendants and all nodes after it cannot be its ancestors. This means the only POSSIBLE ancestors are in front of the given node and all POSSIBLE descendants are behind it. But not every node in front of/behind it has to be its ancestor/descendant. ) TODO this is only true for $D_{top}=0$ isn't it?
- Formal Definition for causal order?
- Causal order only determines an ancestor-descendant relationship. So to draw an edge between two variables we do not need a DIRECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP.


- Formal Def. for Dtop?
- They use the topological divergence metric $D_{top}$  as quality measurement. 
- In this paper $D_{top}$ is calculated by counting the not recoverable edge in the merged final DAG. Not recoverable edges face in the opposite direction than they do in the ground truth DAG. 
(- $D_{top}$ is a better measurement than SHD because $D_{top}$ is a measurement for causal order while SHD is a measurement for graph equality. $D_{top}$ can be $0$ for a changed sequence or permutations of the same order. But a changed graph will lead to SHD $> 0$. ) Is this true? TODO


- Most other papers use graphs as outputs for the domain knowledge, which are "final" and not adaptable. This is problematic because we often want to process them further. So the DAG being "final" leads to errors in further processing.
- Causal order is not final, it can adapt missing variables later on 
- Given only a subset of variables, an optimal perfect expert will always predict a correct causal order for the whole set, but a causal graph could be incorrect. 


- But inferring causal order from LLMs/imperfect experts through pairwise prompting leads to many cycles 
- To get more accurate graphs with significantly fewer cycles, they also introduce a triplet-based prompting strategy
- Fewer cycles because a pair occurs more than once, at least for graphs with more than 3 nodes. This can lead to conflicting edges. The final relationship (A->B, B->A, or no edge) is voted for by a majority vote.
- ZITAT: For practical usage, we use the variance in votes for each pair to motivate a final edge removal step that ensures that no cycles are present in the final output. 
- Using the estimated causal order for downstream discovery and effect inference leads to fewer errors


Getting causal order from imperfect Experts

There are different ways to get the causal order from an imperfect Expert such as an LLM. Using just a single prompt for all nodes would likely lead to information overload, which can lead to suboptimal results. To avoid this, we could use two nodes, the smallest possible set for inferring causal order, for every prompt and infer causal order by going through all possible TODO pairs (or tuples?) one at a time and then aggregating the outputs. But this leads to many cycles in the final graph (leading to $D_{top} > 0$). To reduce these cycles, they propose a triplet-based query strategy, which even has a better performance than the pairwise strategy.

The algorithm

Include Algorithm graphic

Compute all possible triplets from the given node set. 

Then ask the expert, in our case the LLM, to generate the causal DAG. In this paper, the prompt also included the context, the request to give the reasoning behind the edges, node descriptions, and examples for the wanted input and output structure. (TODO did we use the prompt? we could just make a cite)

Count the number of appearances of the three orientations (A $\rightarrow$ B, B $\rightarrow$ A, or no connection) for each pair of nodes. If one of the three orientations appears in more than 50\% of the triplets it can be in, it will be picked for the final causal graph. If it is equal to or lower than 50\% for all orientations, the expert will be asked to pick one through reasoning. 

Merge the computed orientations for every pair to get the final DAG from which we can extract the causal order.

This causal order might only be true for the graph we produced. It does not have to be true for the ground truth DAG of the problem. This is what leads do $D_{top} \neq 0$. 

This order can now be used as a prior for causal discovery algorithms and effect inference.

In this paper, they used PC and CaMML.


- TODO I don't get it. Is this even important? ZITAT:
 While the causal order is a simpler structure than the full graph, it is useful by itself, aiding downstream
tasks like effect inference and graph discovery. For example, correct causal order is sufficient for
identifying a valid backdoor set for any pair of treatment and outcome variables. Moreover, a
causal order-based metric, topological divergence (Dtop), correlates better with the effect estimation
accuracy than commonly used graph metrics such as structural hamming distance (SHD). Specifically,
Dtop = 0 if and only if the causal order provides a valid backdoor adjustment set. In contrast, there
exist predicted graphs where the identified backdoor set is accurate (and topological divergence is
zero), but their SHD can be arbitrarily high. In addition to effect inference, causal order can also
be used to improve the accuracy of graph discovery algorithms. To this end, we provide simple
algorithms for using causal order to improve existing causal discovery algorithms.

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chapter-Methodology}

First, I installed the library from \cite{causal_learn} with all its prerequisites (and the prerequisites of the prerequisites namely pygraphviz). 


The sachs dataset was downloaded from https://github.com/snarles/causal/blob/master/bnlearn_files/sachs.data.txt


For the PC algorithm I used the default PC algorithm from \cite{causal-learn} which resembles the algorithm from \cite{pc}. I only changed it, so it would not show the progress in the terminal.
PC is the same as in \cite{causal-order}.

The SCORE algorithm is from \cite{score}. I've copied some of the code files from their Github page into my project and installed all their libraries to use the programmed algorithm.
SCORE is the same as in \cite{causal-order}.

Given the variables:
1.

Go through the following steps 1 by 1 and justify/(give your reasoning for) each.
1. Build all possible (n! / 3!(n−3)!) with n=4 triplets.

  abstract = 	 {This paper demonstrates how to recover causal graphs from the score of the data distribution in non-linear additive (Gaussian) noise models. Using score matching algorithms as a building block, we show how to design a new generation of scalable causal discovery methods. To showcase our approach, we also propose a new efficient method for approximating the score’s Jacobian, enabling to recover the causal graph. Empirically, we find that the new algorithm, called SCORE, is competitive with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods while being significantly faster.}
